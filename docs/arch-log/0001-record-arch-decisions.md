**Date:** `2026-01-26`

**Status:** `Accepted`

### **Context**

It is necessary to formally document all application architecture decisions to ensure long-term maintainability and knowledge sharing within the team.

---

### **Decision**

For all architectural decisions, an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) will be maintained.

Each ADR will be a Markdown file created and managed and versioned on Github. We will use the [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which includes the following sections: Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences.

---

### **Consequences**

- All architectural decisions must be recorded in the log. Old decisions should be recorded retroactively with an approximate decision date.
- New decisions must be recorded on a regular basis.
