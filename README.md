# 💳 Digital Wallet API - Modular Monolith

This is a Financial/Fintech API designed to demonstrate advanced architectural patterns using **Java 25**, **Spring Modulith**, and **GraalVM**. The project implements a digital wallet system where users can manage accounts, perform transactions, and receive notifications.

## 🎯 Project Scope

The primary goal of this project is to consolidate advanced software engineering concepts into a single, maintainable, and scalable **Modular Monolith**.

### Core Features
* **Account Management:** KYC (Know Your Customer) flow, account creation, and balance tracking.
* **Transaction Engine:** Secure peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, deposits, and withdrawals with ACID compliance.
* **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive history of all financial movements.
* **Notifications:** Real-time alerts for successful or failed operations.

### Advanced Learning Scenarios (MVP)
* **Statement Projection (CQRS Read Side):** Denormalized statement table updated asynchronously from `TransactionCompletedEvent`.
* **Account Lock States:** Account aggregate with ACTIVE/BLOCKED/PENDING_KYC; BLOCKED prevents debits but allows credits.
* **Pockets/Sub-accounts:** Pockets/caixinhas add up to the total wallet balance; transfers cannot spend pocket funds without authorization.
* **Daily Transfer Limits:** Policy checks daily accumulated amount before allowing new debits.
* **Compensating Transactions:** Issue reversal/estorno when downstream steps fail, simulating saga behavior inside the monolith.

## 🏗️ Architectural Foundations

The project is built upon four main pillars documented in our [ADRs](./Docs/Arch-log/)

1.  **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Strategic mapping of the banking domain into Bounded Contexts.
2.  **Modular Monolith:** Physical and logical separation of modules using **Spring Modulith**, ensuring low coupling.
3.  **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters):** Strict **Dependency Inversion (DIP)** where the business logic (Core) is isolated from external technologies.
4.  **CQRS:** Separation of Command (Write) and Query (Read) flows to optimize performance.

## 📡 Event-Driven Communication

To maintain strict isolation between modules (e.g., `Transaction` and `Notification`), we avoid direct service calls. Instead, we use **Internal Domain Events** managed by Spring Modulith.

### How it works:
* **Decoupling:** The `Transaction` module publishes `TransactionCompletedEvent` and doesn't care who consumes it.
* **Event Publication Registry:** We use Spring Modulith's **Event Publication Registry** to ensure "at-least-once" delivery. If the notification service is down, the event is persisted in the database and retried later.
* **Asynchronicity:** Notifications are processed in separate threads, ensuring the main transaction flow remains fast and responsive.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each module follows the Hexagonal internal structure:

```text
src/main/java/com/edu/api/pop_cube_wallet
├── [module-name]/           # e.g., account, transaction
│   ├── domain/              # Entities, Aggregates, and Repository Interfaces (Ports)
│   ├── application/         # CQRS Handlers (Commands/Queries) and Use Cases
│   ├── infrastructure/      # JPA Adapters, External API Clients, Configurations
│   └── web/                 # REST Controllers (Input Adapters)
└── Application.java
```

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

We use **ArchUnit** and **Spring Modulith Test** to ensure architectural integrity:

* **Module Interaction:** Verified via `ApplicationModules.of(Application.class).verify()`.
* **DIP Check:** Domain layer is strictly forbidden from importing Infrastructure classes.
* **Documentation:** Automatic generation of module dependency diagrams and Canvas.
